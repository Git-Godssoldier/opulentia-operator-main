# ðŸš€ Git Setup and Push Commands

Since Xcode command line tools aren't available in this environment, you'll need to run these commands in your terminal to set up git and push to remote:

## 1. Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/kingopulentia/Downloads/SuperPowers/opulentia-operator-main

# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create initial commit with comprehensive message
git commit -m "Complete Scrapybara operator implementation with MCP integration

âœ… Fixed Scrapybara API endpoint 404 issue
- Updated environments.ts to include /v1 path
- Fixed all client files to remove duplicate /v1 prefixes
- Corrected base URL configuration for proper API connectivity

âœ… Enhanced agent execution implementation  
- Replaced mock executeEnhancedStep with real Scrapybara SDK calls
- Added actual browser interactions: screenshots, computer actions, bash commands
- Implemented proper session management and error handling

âœ… Added comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Created Playwright test suite with 18 passing tests
- Added tests for launch functionality, environment config, URL construction
- Verified functionality across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit

âœ… Created CI/CD pipeline
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Included smoke tests for Scrapybara launch functionality  
- Added build verification on every push

âœ… Configured complete MCP ecosystem

## 2. Add Remote Repository

Choose one of these options based on where you want to host your repository:

### Option A: GitHub
```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/opulentia-operator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: Existing Remote
```bash
# If you already have a remote repository URL:
git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE
git branch -M main  
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Push
```bash
# Check remote status
git remote -v

# Check branch status
git branch -a

# Verify latest commit
git log --oneline -1
```

## 4. Future Updates
```bash
# For future changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed:
```bash
# Create repository and push in one command
gh repo create opulentia-operator --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Next Steps After Git Push

1. Set up branch protection rules (if using GitHub)
2. Configure repository secrets for CI/CD
3. Set up issue templates and PR templates
4. Add collaborators if needed
5. Consider setting up automated deployments from main branch
