3. **Direct Computer Control**: Mouse, keyboard, and screen automation
4. **Real-time Streaming**: Live view of automation execution

The agent flow:
1. AI analyzes the user's goal
2. Selects appropriate instance type (Ubuntu/Browser/Windows)
3. Launches cloud instance with streaming capability
4. Executes step-by-step automation with intelligent reasoning
5. Provides real-time feedback and results
