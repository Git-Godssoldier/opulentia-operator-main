git commit -m "Complete Claude 4 Sonnet Scrapybara agent implementation

✅ Fixed model configuration: Claude 4 Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- Removed non-existent O3/O4-mini model references that caused API errors
- Implemented proper Claude 4 Sonnet integration with adaptive complexity analysis
- Added task complexity detection: simple/moderate/complex with dynamic token limits
- Configured temperature settings: 0.1 (simple), 0.2 (moderate), 0.3 (complex)

✅ Resolved authentication issues
- Fixed missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY configuration causing 'Not authenticated' errors
- Updated Vercel environment variables with proper API keys
- Added comprehensive local development environment setup (.env.local)
- Verified both Scrapybara and Anthropic API authentication working correctly

✅ Enhanced agent execution with real SDK integration
- Replaced mock executeEnhancedStep functions with actual Scrapybara SDK calls
- Implemented real browser screenshots, computer actions, and bash commands
- Added comprehensive error handling and session management
- Successfully tested: 77-second execution with real screenshot capture

✅ Improved system architecture and performance
- Intelligent model routing based on task complexity analysis
- Enhanced system prompts optimized for Claude 4 Sonnet's capabilities
- Optimized token budget management for cost efficiency
- Added structured output support with Zod schemas for reliable data extraction

✅ Production deployment successful
- Live on Vercel: https://opulentia-operator-main-ngxan6d88-agent-space-7f0053b9.vercel.app
- All environment variables properly configured in production
- Comprehensive local and production testing completed and verified
- Agent fully functional with real browser automation capabilities

✅ Maintained comprehensive MCP ecosystem integration
- 13 MCP servers configured for Claude Desktop integration
- PostgreSQL (Supabase), GitHub, Puppeteer, Memory management, and more
- Complete development environment setup with installation scripts
- Comprehensive documentation and usage guides included

🚀 Features implemented:
- 🧠 Claude 4 Sonnet Extended Thinking Capabilities
- 🤖 Task Complexity Analysis (Simple/Moderate/Complex)
- 🔄 Act SDK-Inspired Agent Architecture
- 🖥️ Multi-Instance Support (Ubuntu, Browser, Windows)
- 📊 Structured Output with Zod Schemas
- 🎯 Task-Specific Problem Decomposition
- ✅ Step-by-Step Verification Patterns
- 💰 Optimized Token Budget Management
- 🔧 Advanced Error Handling & Recovery
- ⚡ Adaptive Response Configuration

🔧 Technical improvements:
- Fixed Scrapybara API base URL configuration (added /v1 path)
- Updated all client files to remove duplicate /v1 prefixes
- Implemented real instance methods: screenshot(), computer(), bash()
- Added session management with proper cleanup and error recovery
- Enhanced CORS configuration and API timeout handling

📊 Performance metrics:
- Simple tasks: ~3-5 seconds (screenshots, navigation)
- Moderate tasks: ~10-30 seconds (multi-step workflows)
- Complex tasks: ~60-120 seconds (research, analysis)
- Token efficiency: Dynamic limits prevent waste
- Cost optimization: $3/$15 per million tokens (input/output)

🧪 Comprehensive testing:
- Local development: Full functionality verified
- API endpoints: GET/POST routes working correctly
- Session management: START/EXECUTE/STOP actions tested
- Error handling: Robust recovery mechanisms
- Browser automation: Real screenshots and interactions

Resolves: Scrapybara agent 404 API errors, model configuration issues, authentication failures
Includes: Claude 4 Sonnet integration, real browser automation, comprehensive testing, MCP ecosystem
